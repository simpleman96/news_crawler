Sign up here. Now you can social distance and feel like royalty at the same time. As restaurants reopen, many are looking for ways to remind customers to maintain social distancing. While some establishments reduced the amount of seating available and painted markings on the floor to customers separated, one fast-food franchise had a different idea. Burger King recently tweeted out an image of two customers enjoying some burgers while using special Burger King crowns to stay safe. The oversized headgear reportedly extends far enough off of the wearer’s head to make sure that they stay 6 feet away from other customers. When a Twitter user asked where they could get one, Burger King informed them that these crowns were available to customers in Germany. PIZZA HUT GIVING AWAY 500,000 PIZZAS TO 2020'S GRADUATING SENIORS A spokesperson for Burger King told Business Insider, “We wanted to reenforce the rules of high safety and hygiene standards that the BK restaurants are following. The do-it-yourself social distance crown was a fun and playful way to remind our guests to practice social distancing while they are enjoying food in the restaurants.” This isn’t the only playful way the fast-food franchise has promoted social distancing.

Sign up here. Las Vegas is set to reopen casinos following its coronavirus lockdown, but guests should not expect a return to business as usual. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak set a tentative date of June 4 to reopen casinos statewide following two weeks of continued decrease in both new cases and hospitalizations. Should the decline continue through the weekend, Sisolak will hold a press conference on Tuesday to reveal further rollbacks as part of the next phase to reopen the state. CLICK FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS Virginia Valentine, president and CEO of the Nevada Resort Association, applauded the governor's decision, calling it "fantastic news" for Nevada's gaming industry. "Our members have spent more than two months preparing for this day," she said in an emailed statement to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "They've put in place enhanced health and safety plans and protocols ... Our memebers are excited to show off the enhancements they've made that preserve the experience while ensuring the well-being of our employees and visitors." Casinos are required to submit plans for reopening, which will require approval at least seven days ahead of actually opening their doors. Other businesses, such as nightclubs, dayclubs, buffets and large venues will remain closed – including the infamous Cirque du Soleil. MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONL REVEALS SAFETY PLAN FOR REOPENING “You’re going to see a lot of social distancing,” said Sean McBurney, general manager at Caesars Palace. “If there’s crowding, it’s every employee’s responsibility to ensure there’s social distancing.” Guests will see signs everywhere that remind them to wash their hands, maintain social distancing and limit gatherings to four people when possible. The most striking difference will be a limit on games and participants: four players only at roulette, six at craps. Plastic partitions will separate dealers from players and players from each other at the Bellagio, three at each table, and slot machines will be shut down to discourage players from sitting near each other. LAS VEGAS MAYOR SLAMS CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWNS AS 'TOTAL INSANITY' “Visually, you’ll still see a lot of color and activity, but you won’t be able to play every machine,” McBurney said. New state Gaming Control Board regulations require that casinos disinfect surfaces and give “increased attention” to high-touch hotel items like television remote controls and light switches. Dice will be disinfected between shooters, chips cleaned periodically and card decks changed frequently. At some resorts guests will be encouraged to use cellphones for touchless check in, as room keys and to read restaurant menus. Large resorts will hand out free masks to guests, but won’t require their use. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “We all know what we’ve gone through for the last 10 weeks. No one’s having fun,” said Bill Hornbuckle, acting chief executive and president of casino giant MGM Resorts International. “The simple idea that I could get out, come to a resort, lay at a pool, enjoy a nice dinner, sit at a blackjack table. There’s something to be said for all of that.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Sign up here. White House National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien compared on Sunday China’s response to the coronavirus pandemic to that of the Soviet Union’s reaction during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. “This was a virus that was unleashed by China. There was a coverup that someday they’re going to do an HBO show like they did with Chernobyl on this virus,” O’Brien said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday. O’Brien was referring to the 2019 miniseries that dramatized the 1986 explosion of a reactor at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine and the response from Soviet officials. O’Brien added that, like Soviet officials in the 1980s, Chinese officials have covered up the extent of the pandemic -- which first surfaced late last year in Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China’s Hubei province – because “they kicked out all reporters and they wouldn’t let [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] investigators come in and they’re still stonewalling investigators.” CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE “It doesn’t matter if it was local officials or the Chinese Communist Party, it was a coverup and we’ll get to the bottom of it eventually,” he added. On vaccine development, O’Brien said he was confident that the United States will develop one before China does and added that he thinks that Beijing will try to steal U.S. intellectual property if the vaccine is first developed in the U.S. “There’s a chance, and it’s been reported, that the Chinese have been engaged in espionage to try to find the research and the technologies that we’re working on both for a vaccine and a therapy,” he said. “They’ve got a many-year history of stealing American intellectual property and knocking off American technology and I wouldn’t be surprised if they did that with the vaccines.” The U.S. is pushing the World Health Organization to start work “now” on a planned independent review of its coordinated international response to the COVID-19 outbreak, at a time the Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the agency and is threatening to cut off U.S. funding for it. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, sent a letter to the UN health agency’s executive board meeting on Friday saying the United States believes the WHO can “immediately initiate" preparations such as bringing together independent health experts and setting up guidelines for the review. President Trump has continually blamed China for allowing the pathogen to spread beyond its borders. “This is a hit that came out of China,” Trump said during an interview that aired on WJLA on Sunday. “Whether we like it or not, it came out of China. It could have been stopped.”

Sign up here. Simon Cowell, one of Hollywood's busiest, is trying to keep himself occupied during the coronavirus quarantine. The reality television personality offered some sage advice to fans in an interview with Extra. HILARY DUFF SHUTS DOWN 'DISGUSTING' SEX TRAFFICKING TWITTER RUMORS ABOUT HER SON LUCA “Most importantly, occupy your mind,” said Cowell, 60. “You have to stick to a routine. Fortunately, with things like with Zoom, you stay in touch with the world, keep motivated, come up with ideas... I never get this time, normally.” While quarantining, Cowell has been enjoying time with his partner Lauren Silverman and 6-year-old son Eric. "I was concerned how [Eric] was going to cope with all of this. He has been absolutely amazing," gushed Cowell. "He is still able to do schoolwork, and now we are camping on the weekends in the garden.” Camping didn't go over so well for Lauren during the family's first attempt. “Lauren, the first time, 11 o’clock said, ‘I can’t deal with this,'" recalled the reality star. "And I said ‘No, we are staying outside.’” EDWARD VIII WAS 'OBSESSIVE' AND 'SUFFOCATING' WITH AMERICAN DIVORCE WALLIS SIMSON, DOC SAYS Aside from camping, Cowell's been keeping himself busy with a handful of other activities. “I’m doing a bit of cooking, I’m exercising. Funny enough, more during this time as well, sticking to the diet," he said, noting he can keep better track of his diet at home. “The only difficult thing is when Eric orders a pizza... That’s the number one thing I miss.” Although he's had to give up pizza, the diet is paying off for Cowell. "I think I have dropped, since I started this diet a year ago, 60 pounds," he said. Cowell also has Monday's "America's Got Talent" season premiere to look forward to. “I’ve seen the first episodes now, and even for us watching as a family is total escapism,” said the judge. “The fact that everyone’s managed to put this together remotely... I think they’ve done an outstanding job, and the show I am very, very proud of.” Additionally, this season, Sofia Vergara was welcomed to the judges' table -- which Cowell said has been a plus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "She was amazing," he gushed. "After 10 minutes, literally, in the first day, she turned to me and said, ‘Simon, this is the best job I ever had.’ She was very good with the contestants, very focused.

Hutchinson optimistic about economic recovery despite recent high in new COVID cases|Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here. The state of Arkansas is moving forward with reopening its economy, which was never fully shut down during the coronavirus pandemic, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he is "optimistic" about the future, even as the state had its highest number of new cases to date this past Thursday. The White House recommended that states not reopen until they have seen a steady two-week decline in new cases, while Arkansas has seen ups and downs in recent days. Hutchinson, however, is taking a big-picture view and told "Fox News Sunday" that, on the whole, he is encouraged by what he sees. AMERICA REOPENING: 14 MORE STATES EASE RESTRICTIONS BEFORE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND “We’re expanding our economy, but right now we have less than 100 hospitalizations; our death rate is low compared to the rest of the country," Hutchinson said. "It doesn’t diminish the seriousness with which we take it, but we have to manage the risk, grow our economy, we have to come back and not just in Arkansas but nationally. Because this virus is deadly but it’s going to be with us a while. We have to manage that risk.” Hutchinson defended the decision to reopen stores, movie theaters and gyms with lower capacities, in light of the relatively low number of cases. He acknowledged that there is still a risk involved in reopening, but said individuals can take precautions to protect themselves. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE "Well, my thinking is we have to manage the risk. We take the virus very seriously, it’s a risk, it causes death, but you can’t cloister yourself at home, that is just contrary to the American spirit," he said. "And we have to discipline ourselves, we have to manage the risk. I make the comparison with you: could be in an automobile and it’s very risky, but you manage the risk by wearing a seatbelt.” Hutchinson never issued a full stay-at-home order for his state like other governors have, and he is moving forward with reopening even though the state had its highest number of daily cases this past Thursday. That spike followed a low count the previous day, and Hutchinson pointed to less than 5 percent of people tested being positive as a reason for optimism. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That number is doubled by the percent of people in the state who are unemployed, but Hutchinson noted that Arkansas' 10.2 percent unemployment is 4 percent lower than the national average. He credited to lack of a stay-at-home order for this, and said it is the reason why Arkansas will come back relatively soon. “Our economy is stronger than and will rebound more quickly because it was not all shut down and people are going back to work," Hutchinson said, adding that he is “optimistic about coming back, it’s just going to take some time.”

Sign up here. The head of the National Center for Assisted Living blamed a “flawed survey system” for the recent government watchdog report that found widespread problems with infectious disease controls in nursing homes across the country. Mark Parkinson, the president and chief executive officer of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, said on Sunday that people surveying nursing homes across the country were encouraged to find problems and that is why a Government Accountability Office report released last week found that eight in 10 nursing homes inspected were cited for infection-control problems. “We have a real flawed survey system and one of the flaws in the system is surveyors are encouraged to give deficiencies and that makes the impression that even very good buildings are deficient,” Parkinson said on “Fox News Sunday.” The GAO report comes as nursing homes across the country have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE An ongoing count by The Associated Press has found that outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have killed more than 30,000 people, more than one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the country. In Massachusetts, the coronavirus late last month killed at least 80 veterans – with 82 other residents and 81 staff members testing positive for the contagion – at Holyoke Soldiers' Home. Overall, the outbreak has claimed the lives of nearly one-third of all residents at the veterans' home. “It’s horrific,” said Edward Lapointe, whose father-in-law lives at the home and had a mild case of the virus. “These guys never had a chance.” New York, as with much of the other grim news from the outbreak, has been the epicenter of deaths in nursing homes with more than 5,000 being reported as of earlier last week. It was reported last week that more than 4,500 recovering coronavirus patients were sent to New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes under a controversial state directive that was ultimately scrapped amid criticisms it was accelerating the nation’s deadliest outbreaks. The GAO report, which analyzed data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from 2013 to 2017, found that 82 percent of nursing homes – over 13,000 in all – had received citations for either cutting corners or failing to implement to correct controls in that time frame. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, on May 10 reversed the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged. But he continued to defend it this week, saying he didn't believe it contributed to the more than 5,800 nursing and adult care facility deaths in New York — more than in any other state — and that homes should have spoken up if it was a problem. “Any nursing home could just say, ‘I can’t handle a COVID person in my facility,'" he said, although the March 25 order didn’t specify how homes could refuse, saying that ”no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the (nursing home) solely based" on confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The GAO report found that about 40 percent of the nursing homes inspected in each of the past two years were cited for problems with infection control and prevention. Looking deeper into federal data for 2013-2017, investigators found a recurring pattern of problems. Data for that five-year period showed that 82 percent of nursing homes inspected, or 13,299, had at least one deficiency related to infection control and prevention. About half of the facilities had an infection-related deficiency in multiple consecutive years. “Our analysis of CMS data shows that infection prevention and control deficiencies were the most common type of deficiency cited in surveyed nursing homes,” John Dicken, the director of the health care team at the GAO, wrote in a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on a committee that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. “Infection prevention and control deficiencies cited by surveyors can include situations where nursing home staff did not regularly use proper hand hygiene or failed to implement preventive measures during an infectious disease outbreak, such as isolating sick residents and using masks and other personal protective equipment to control the spread of infection." Dicken added: “Many of these practices can be critical to preventing the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID19.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Parkinson said on Sunday that one of the reasons nursing homes have been so devastated by COVID-19 was that residents were not seen as high priority and the facilities lacked the proper testing supplies. “The country was too concerned with hospitals being overrun and there were consequences to that, one of the consequences was that nursing homes were left out,” he said. “Our residents were not a high priority for testing, we weren’t given the equipment we needed." Parkinson added: “There needs to be some accountability for all of these people that were making this fantastic estimates that all the hospitals in the country would be overrun—there wasn’t and there were consequences.” Parkinson noted that the Trump administration has allocated $5 billion for the recovery efforts in nursing homes nationwide.

Sign up here. Two Missouri hairstylists at the same salon have potentially directly exposed 147 people to coronavirus after working on clients while showing symptoms for COVID-19. The Springfield-Greene Health Department announced Saturday that a second stylist at a Great Clips in Springfield has tested positive for COVID-19. The stylist, who worked May 16-20 “while experiencing very mild symptoms but potentially infectious,” has potentially exposed 56 clients to the virus. “At this time, this is the only other positive result we have had from those tested as a result of the previous exposure,” the department said in a press release. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE A day earlier, the health department announced the first stylist at the same location at 1864 S. Glenstone Ave. had tested positive. While symptomatic, that individual worked May 12-20, potentially exposing 84 clients and seven co-workers. Both stylists, as well as all their clients, wore masks. The health department said it hoped “because face coverings were worn throughout this exposure timeline, no additional cases will result.” “We are hopeful that their strictly enforced policy of masking will prevent any future spread from this case. They also kept detailed records that have made contact tracing a speedy process,” Springfield-Greene County Health Department Director Clay Goddard said Friday. Contact tracing investigators helped track down customers who were potentially exposed to the virus. Those people will be notified by the health department and offered testing. MISSOURI HAIR STYLIST WENT TO WORK WITH CORONAVIRUS SYMPTOMS, EXPOSED 91 CLIENTS, CO-WORKERS: OFFICIALS The department said anyone else who was at the hair salon on those dates is believed to be at very low risk. Those individuals are advised to watch for symptoms, but there is no need to self-quarantine or isolate unless symptoms develop, the department said in a press release. Symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell. Missouri hair salons, among some other non-essential businesses shuttered during a statewide stay-at-home order, were cleared to reopen on May 4, according to the Kansas City Star. The Great Clips location was closed to undergo sanitizing and deep cleaning under guidelines provided by the county health department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the newspaper reported, citing a statement from the salon owners. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Goddard praised the owners for their swift action, and said the salon was now safe for business. Missouri, as of Sunday, has recorded at least 11,558 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 671 deaths, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.
